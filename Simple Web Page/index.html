       <h1>
        PHRASE SHIFT
       </h1>
      <p> Have you ever experienced a sudden change in perspective that made a difference in how you felt about something? </p>
      <p> What caused the change? What emotions stirred as you first started to question how you used to feel?</p>  
      <p> "Phrase Shift" asked viewers to consider these questions and respond, leaving recorded</p>
      <p> messages for the following user to hear. It was a game of telephone about</p>
      <p> what locks people into rigid mindsets, how to find flexibility</p>
      <p> and what inspires it. Meanwhile a plank of wood </p>
      <p> made pliable by repeated curved cuts</p>
      <p> hovered nearby, as purple</p>
      <p> cubed ice slowly melted</p>
      <p> above. A changing</p>
      <p> state of matter</p>
      <p> slowly drips</p>
      <p> drips</p>
      <p> drips</p>
      <p> drips</p>
